HW4
I use the different algorithm to realize the project sparse matrices.
The program in text book can't be input by irregular order terms into
the program.But my program can input the irregular oder terms and can
output the matrix layout outcome just to use the "mwrite_(matrixPtr)"
function into which passed the pointer of the sparse matrices.
In order to realize printing out the matrix outcome in matrix layout,
it forces me to link the terms depending on their row and column.
Realizing the mmult function just to differentiate the row and column
from a and b sparse matrices.Just like normal matrices mutliplication.
Mwrite funciton,Just follow the row and col access in major row order.
Moreover,I write the overloading mread function to read matrices with 
a pointer link a line of node not like sparse matrices just like one
dimension array.
